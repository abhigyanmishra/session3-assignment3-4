Name Node (also known as master) is the center piece of HDFS. We know Hadoop uses HDFS to store files efficiently in the cluster.
So the Name Node basically manages HDFS storage.
The NameNode in Hadoop is the node where Hadoop stores all the location information of the files in HDFS.
Tracks of all the files in the cluster, infact the directory tree- only metadata is stored by name node. But name node does not actually stores the data (Data is stored in data nodes). It is usually alloted a lot of RAM.
To ensure high availability, you have both an active NameNode and a standby NameNode. Each runs on its own, dedicated master node.

Secondary Name Node
The secondary name node is responsible for performing periodic housekeeping functions for the NameNode. It only creates checkpoints of the filesystem present in the NameNode.
